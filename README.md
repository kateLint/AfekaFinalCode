A machine learning pipeline to predict kickstarter projects success.

---

The raw data file all_good_projects_without_embeddings.json were produced from files downloaded from: https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/ from 2015-2014.
Then projects from scrapped_projects.json were combined with those files, and clean_data.py created the final all_good_projects_without_embeddings.json
